# Quiet on the Set
Prevent someone from turning up the volume on a Windows machine beyond a maximum volume

This is a very simple Windows Forms application that lets you set a maximum value on for your volume, and then lock the setting so that a user cannot change the volume.

*Disclaimer: This app is primarily geared toward young/special needs children. The "lock" provides a basic level of control, but it could be easily bypassed by someone with technical knowledge.*

## Usage ##
1. Run the [installer](https://s3.amazonaws.com/calvinware-installer/quiet-on-the-set-setup.exe)
2. Use the slider to pick the maximum volume
3. At this point, you can choose to use a password, or you can just leave it blank and click **Lock**. If you don't set a password, you only need to click **Unlock** to unlock it again. This is a simple option if you don't think you have to worry about someone messing around with trying to unlock it.
4. At this point, you can close the app and it will minimize to the system tray. **The only way you can leave the app is to click the Exit button when it's unlocked.**
5. If you want this to run every time someone logs in, click the *Start Automatically on login* checkbox
